# MetisClassificationProject

This repo contains code used to collect League of Legends data from the Riot Games API and then create a Random Forest Model to classify a team as winning or losing based on both early game team information (hence there is some leakage, but I judge it acceptable for my purposes) and on individual player performance / characteristics (vision score and champion mastery).

The code for scraping the Riot API to get .csv files is found in the utils folder, along with SQL schemas and a query to pull it from a local PostgreSQL database.

The data folder contains relevant generated data. This is not exactly the same as that generated by the utils, as time constraints got in the way of classifying players by lane, and not by another metric. This is something I may come back to later if I revisit this project. 

The final Random forest model is built in the jupyter notebook and was exported to be wrapped in a Flask app in the Website folder.
